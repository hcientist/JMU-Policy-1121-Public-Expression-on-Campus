Policy 1121
Public Expression on Campus
Date of Current Revision: May 2019
Primary Responsible Officer: Director, Public Safety
Secondary Responsible Officers: Director, Madison Union, and Director, University Recreation Center

1. PURPOSE

The university encourages civic engagement, including vigorous and civil discourse and debate on topics of public interest, both on and off campus. Civil discourse is an important life skill and part of engaged learning, community engagement and civic engagement. The university’s mission to be the national model of the engaged university is fundamentally supported by these activities. Nothing is more central to the concept of engagement in the higher education setting than free expression and civil discourse.

As public citizens, all members of the campus community have rights guaranteed them under the United States Constitution, including the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Closely related to freedom of speech, the university, its faculty and students have academic freedom rights. The academic freedom rights of faculty members are set forth in the Faculty Handbook, section III.A.2.a. Students’ rights to academic freedom are set forth in Academic Affairs Policy 12.

The primary mission of the university is to create an environment for learning, educational activities, and intellectual pursuits of its students and faculty. Many parts of university property are open to the public, but the institution’s physical grounds and facilities exist to serve this educational mission for the campus community, and the mission must remain paramount.

The safety and security of the campus environment is the responsibility of the university. The university reserves the right to respond appropriately to any behavior by any individual that interferes with its primary mission, or interferes with the safety and security of the campus environment or the campus community. As a public institution of higher education, the university will encourage and protect the free and open exchange of ideas in a manner consistent with the requirements of the U.S. Constitution.

This policy is designed to set out the university’s obligations to protect the rights of public exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly on campus, as well as the constitutionally defined parameters of those rights.

The university’s encouragement of civil discourse is not an invitation to disrupt the safe and orderly operation of the campus, threaten members of the university community, or incite violence, and the university reserves the right to sanction those who fail or refuse to abide by the institution’s reasonable and content-neutral time, place and manner regulations. To protect free expression of others on campus, the university has the authority and obligation to enforce rules that restrict and sanction those who seek to significantly interrupt, shut down, or interfere with the expression of others. Additionally, the university reserves the right to respond appropriately to behavior that is not protected speech as defined under law and this policy.

2. AUTHORITY

The Board of Visitors has been authorized by the Commonwealth of Virginia to govern James Madison University. See Code of Virginia § 23.1-1600; § 23.1-1301. The Board has delegated the authority to manage the university to the president.

STATE OR FEDERAL STATUTE AND/OR REGULATION

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the government and its representatives from abridging the freedom of expression and assembly of any individual. The Virginia General Assembly has defined all outdoor areas on campus as protected places for the civil exchange of ideas by students. See Code of Virginia 23.1-401. It has also prohibited the institution from abridging the constitutional freedom of expression of the university’s enrolled students, faculty and other employees, and invited guests. See Code of Virginia 23.1-401.1. 3.

5.2. Faculty members and employees are public citizens, and have constitutionally protected rights of expression. The university supports the academic freedom of its faculty. Faculty members’ rights are set out in the Faculty Handbook https://jmu.edu/facultyhandbook/iii-policies-procedures/a-rights.shtml#IIIA2. Academic freedom applies to all faculty members engaged in educational activities. Academic freedom has corresponding responsibilities, and the university is responsible for evaluating and addressing faculty job performance and conduct.

5.3. Students are public citizens, and have rights of constitutionally protected expression. The university supports the academic freedom of its students. Students’ rights are outlined in the Student Handbook: https://www.jmu.edu/osarp/handbook/OSARP/student-rights.shtml. Students are bound by policies and rules of the institution, and the institution is responsible for evaluating and addressing student academic performance and conduct.

5.4. Speakers who are invited to make presentations on campus by the institution are public citizens, and while they are on campus, they are guests, and are bound by the terms of university policy and agreements concerning their invitations to speak. To reserve facilities for lectures, institutes, workshops, conferences, guest speakers and other programs, members of the university community should make arrangements in advance by contacting the appropriate university scheduling authority. The university will not use the content or viewpoint of an invited speaker’s presentation to withhold or withdraw an invitation to make a presentation on campus.

5.5. The university will enforce appropriate, reasonable, and narrowly tailored time, place and manner regulations on expression and assembly as set out in this policy and other university policies without reference to the content of the speech or the participants in the assembly. These regulations serve the university’s responsibility to maintain the safety and orderly operation of its property, people, and mission. Specifically:

a. Buildings and controlled spaces on campus are reserved for the mission and operation of the institution.

b. Blocking access to and egress from any university facility, building and controlled space is prohibited.

c. Blocking vehicular or foot traffic on roadways and walkways is prohibited.

d. Noise levels that interfere with university functions, business operations, educational activities and the quiet enjoyment of residence halls are prohibited, as are the use of loudspeakers, bullhorns, and other amplification devices at all times without specific permission granted by the institution.

e. No postings, writings, markings, banners, images, symbols or signs of any kind may be placed on or affixed to the outside of buildings, doors, windows, walls, posts, trees, plants, trash or recycling containers, newsstands, vehicles, or any other campus physical features. Postings on university bulletin boards are subject to Policy 3104 - Bulletin Board Use & Posting Public Notices. Leaving leaflets or papers on cars, in outdoor locations on campus, or in buildings, is prohibited (Policy 3104).

Writing or marking on walkways, streets, buildings or any other university property with paint or any other substance but chalk is prohibited.

f. No individual or group may significantly interrupt, shut down, or interfere with the speech or peaceable assembly of others. This includes persistent heckling, shouting down, or blocking views that prohibit another person’s speech or expression from being heard or observed by others.

It is up to the University Police or other law enforcement officials to determine when the interruption or interference is significant enough to warrant intervention.

g. All individuals participating in or observing a demonstration or peaceful assembly must comply with requests of University Police and other law enforcement officials. This specifically includes an order to disperse or to cease attempts to interfere with the speech or peaceable assembly of others.

h. The university may prohibit or shut down an assembly, demonstration, or speaker in circumstances where it determines that the safe and orderly operation of the university will be disrupted by the event, based on the facts known to the institution at the time. If an event is prohibited or shut down by the institution for safety or operational reasons, the university will attempt to provide an opportunity for the speaker or group to reschedule, or to provide alternative space for the event, if possible. The university will not censor or punish any public, constitutionally protected expression simply because a person or group finds it offensive. The university may prohibit, stop or impose sanctions for conduct that is not protected under this policy or the law, whether or not such conduct disrupts the safe and orderly operation of the institution.

5.6. University employees have professional and job-related responsibilities and are bound by university policy when operating within the context of their employment. This includes the responsibility to abide by all rules concerning an employee’s expression on behalf of the institution, and to identify when the employee is speaking as a private citizen, rather than on behalf of the institution (Policy 1508).
