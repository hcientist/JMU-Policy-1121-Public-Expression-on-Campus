Policy 1121
Public Expression on Campus
Date of Current Revision: August 2024
Primary Responsible Officer: Chief of Police
Secondary Responsible Officers: Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, Student Life and Involvement

1. PURPOSE

The university encourages civic engagement, including vigorous and civil discourse and debate on topics of public interest, both on and off campus. Civil discourse is an important life skill and part of engaged learning, community engagement, and civic engagement. The university’s mission to be the national model of the engaged university is fundamentally supported by these activities. Nothing is more central to the concept of engagement in the higher education setting than free expression and civil discourse.

As public citizens, all members of the campus community have rights guaranteed them under the United States Constitution, including the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Closely related to freedom of speech, the university, its faculty and students have academic freedom rights. The academic freedom rights of faculty members are set forth in the Faculty Handbook, section III.A.2.a. Students’ rights to academic freedom are set forth in Academic Affairs Policy 12.

The primary mission of the university is to create an environment for learning, educational activities, and intellectual pursuits of its students and faculty. Many parts of university property are open to the public, but the institution’s physical grounds and facilities exist to serve this educational mission for the campus community, and the mission must remain paramount. This policy is designed to set out the university’s obligations to protect the rights of public exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly on campus, as well as the constitutionally defined parameters of those rights.

2. AUTHORITY

The Board of Visitors has been authorized by the Commonwealth of Virginia to govern James Madison University. See Code of Virginia § 23.1-1600; § 23.1-1301. The Board has delegated the authority to manage the university to the president.

STATE OR FEDERAL STATUTE AND/OR REGULATION

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the government and its representatives from abridging the freedom of expression and assembly of any individual. The Virginia General Assembly has defined all outdoor areas on campus as protected places for the civil exchange of ideas by students. See Code of Virginia 23.1-401. It has also prohibited the institution from abridging the constitutional freedom of expression of the university’s enrolled students, faculty and other employees, and invited guests. See Code of Virginia 23.1-401.1. 3. Code of Virginia § 18.2-56 regarding hazing.

It applies to all areas of the campus and all real property owned or controlled by the university.

5. POLICY

The safety and security of the campus environment is the responsibility of the university. The university reserves the right to respond appropriately to any behavior by any individual that interferes with its primary mission or interferes with the safety and security of the campus environment or the campus community. As a public institution of higher education, the university will encourage and protect the free and open exchange of ideas in a manner consistent with the requirements of the U.S. Constitution.

The university’s encouragement of civil discourse is not an invitation to disrupt the safe and orderly operation of the campus, threaten members of the university community, or incite violence, and the university reserves the right to sanction those who fail or refuse to abide by the institution’s reasonable and content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations. To protect free expression of others on campus, the university has the authority and obligation to enforce rules that restrict and sanction those who seek to significantly interrupt, shut down, or interfere with the expression of others. Additionally, the university reserves the right to respond appropriately to behavior that is not protected speech as defined under law and this policy.

5.1 In classes and instructional activities, students and faculty are encouraged to engage in free speech and exercise their academic freedom rights through civil discourse concerning the subject matter covered by the course.

5.2 In outdoor areas on campus other than controlled spaces, university community members and members of the public are encouraged to exercise their constitutionally protected rights of free expression and freedom of assembly, subject only to reasonable, content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations.

5.3 Faculty members and employees are public citizens and have constitutionally protected rights of expression. The university supports the academic freedom of its faculty. Faculty members’ rights are set out in the Faculty Handbook. Academic freedom applies to all faculty members engaged in educational activities. Academic freedom has corresponding responsibilities, and the university is responsible for evaluating and addressing faculty job performance and conduct.

5.4 Students are public citizens and have rights of constitutionally protected expression. The university supports the academic freedom of its students. Students are bound by policies and rules of the institution, including those set forth by the Student Handbook Standards of Conduct and Policies. The institution is responsible for evaluating and addressing student academic performance and conduct.

5.5 Speakers invited to make presentations on campus by the institution are public citizens, and while they are on campus, they are guests and are bound by the terms of university policy and agreements concerning their invitations to speak. To reserve facilities for lectures, institutes, workshops, conferences, guest speakers, and other programs, members of the university community must make arrangements in advance by contacting the appropriate university scheduling authority and adhering to event management policies. The university will not use the content or viewpoint of an invited speaker’s presentation to withhold or withdraw an invitation to make a presentation on campus. All events must have an institution-affiliated sponsor. The sponsor must have someone onsite or immediately available throughout the event.

5.6 The university will enforce appropriate, reasonable, and narrowly tailored time, place and manner regulations on expression and assembly as set out in this policy and other university policies without reference to the content of the speech or the participants in the assembly. These regulations serve the university’s responsibility to maintain the safety and orderly operation of its property, people, and mission. Specifically:

a. Buildings and controlled spaces on campus are reserved for the mission and operation of the institution. Certain locations are altogether prohibited from usage for events, including residence halls, administrative buildings, and academic buildings during class time.

b. Blocking access to and egress from any university facility, building, and controlled space is prohibited.

c. Blocking, obstructing, or impeding vehicular or foot traffic on roadways and walkways is prohibited.

d. Noise levels that interfere with university functions, business operations, educational activities and the quiet enjoyment of residence halls are prohibited, as are the use of loudspeakers, bullhorns, and other amplification devices at all times without specific permission granted by the institution. At no time may the decibel level inside any academic building or library be in excess of 70 dBA for a prolonged period of time, without permission from building coordinators. University Police shall be notified to evaluate any questionable or prolonged noise inside these buildings.

e. No postings, writings, markings, banners, images, symbols or signs of any kind shall be placed on or hung inside windows visible to the exterior, or affixed to the exterior of buildings, doors, windows, posts, trees, plants, trash or recycling containers, newsstands, vehicles, or any other campus physical features. Exceptions may be made for the display of JMU-related banners by seeking written approval from the Vice President for Administration and Finance according to procedure 6.4. Interior doors remain subject to the provisions within Policy 3104, section 6.4. Postings on university bulletin boards are subject to Policy 3104 - Bulletin Board Use & Posting Public Notices.

f. Buildings shall be illuminated or backlit consistent with the University Identity System and Brand Guide which calls for the use of purple, gold, and white lights only. No external requests for illumination of university buildings will be accepted.

g. Leaving leaflets or papers on cars, in outdoor locations on campus, or in buildings, is prohibited (Policy 3104).

h. Chalking of walkways and streets is prohibited, except with permission granted by the Office of Student Life, on a content-neutral basis, according to the provisions of Policy 3104. Writing or marking on walkways, streets, buildings or any other university property with paint or any other substance but chalk is prohibited.

i. No person may obstruct, disrupt, or attempt by physical force to cancel or discontinue speech by any speaker, or the observation of speech by any person intending to see or hear a speaker. This includes persistent heckling, shouting down, or blocking views that prohibit another person’s speech or expression from being heard or observed by others. It also includes removing or defacing other individuals’ or groups’ approved postings. Whether the interruption or interference is significant enough to warrant criminal charges is determined by the university police.

j. All individuals participating in or observing a demonstration or peaceful assembly must
comply with requests of University Police and other law enforcement officers who will
enforce all federal, state, and local laws, regulations, orders and ordinances. This
specifically includes an order to disperse or to cease attempts to interfere with the
speech or peaceable assembly of others.

k. The university may prohibit or shut down an assembly, demonstration, or speaker in circumstances where it determines that the safe and orderly operation of the university will be disrupted by the event, based on the facts known to the institution at the time. If an event is prohibited or shut down by the institution for safety or operational reasons, the university will attempt to provide an opportunity for the speaker or group to reschedule, or to provide alternative space for the event, if possible. The university will not censor or punish any public, constitutionally protected expression simply because a person or group finds it offensive. The university may prohibit, stop, or impose sanctions for conduct that is not protected under this policy or the law, whether or not such conduct disrupts the safe and orderly operation of the institution.

l. Constructing, occupying, or sleeping in tents or camping on university-owned or operated properties is prohibited unless approved in advance by the university. Tents shall include any structure, enclosure, or shelter with or without sidewalls or drops that is constructed of canvas or pliable material supported in any manner except by the contents it protects. Camping shall include:

* The use of any item to create a shelter
* the outdoor use of heating devices, generators, or the use of portable toilets
* sleeping outdoors with or without a tent between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.

5.7 Affiliated persons and student organizations may utilize outdoor non-controlled university property for public speaking or distribution of literature, so long as they do not disrupt or obstruct the normal living and work environments of other members of the university community or the functions or activities of the university (as well as activities conducted on the university’s property with its permission). Examples include: blocking entrances, corridors or exits; interfering with ongoing educational activities cultural events, or recreational, extracurricular or athletic programs; unauthorized presence in a building after normal closing hours or after notice that the building is being closed; interfering with vehicular or pedestrian traffic; creating unsanitary conditions; and interfering with any other effort to protect the health and safety of members of the university community or larger public.

5.8 Unaffiliated persons wishing to engage in public speaking or distribution of literature on outdoor university property may do so in non-controlled spaces. The Quad is not a designated location that unaffiliated persons may use for public speaking or distribution of literature, except through advanced approval, (See 6.2). Unaffiliated persons wishing to utilize the controlled spaces designated for public speaking or distribution of literature may do so by contacting Student Life in advance of the desired speaking date. Reservations are allocated on a space-available basis with priority given to student organizations and affiliated persons.

a. In addition to the opportunities for speech by unaffiliated persons outlined in this subsection, events that are held in indoor university facilities and are open to the public, or to select unaffiliated persons, create a right to peaceful demonstration and protest at the venue, and in a manner which remains consistent with peaceful assembly. Persons can peacefully assemble, in support or in protest, on university property in specific relation to such events in a manner that:

1. does not impede normal operations of the university or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic
2. is consistent with university policies, and
3. complies with any event-specific security requirements. The group originally requesting the controlled space must contact JMU Police Department at least 14 days prior to their event to obtain a security review as part of the event authorization process. The chief of police must approve security reviews when less than 14 days prior notice is given.

5.9 University employees have professional and job-related responsibilities and are bound by university policy when operating within the context of their employment. This includes the responsibility to abide by all rules concerning an employee’s expression on behalf of the institution, and to identify when the employee is speaking as a private citizen, rather than on behalf of the institution (Policy 1508).

5.10 Consistent with Virginia Code 18.2-422, any individual who is present on university property or attending a university event who is wearing a mask, hood, or other device whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden or covered so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, must present an identification document when requested by an authorized university employee or otherwise establish their identity to the satisfaction of the authorized university employee.

a speaker to make a presentation on campus, as provided in the university rules for rental of
university space.
